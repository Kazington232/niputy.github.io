<p>Shrek is the titular character from the animated film series by the same name created by DreamWorks Studios based on a book[4] by American cartoonist William Steig. Although fans for the character already existed as early as 2001 with the release of the first film, the character didn't got substantial cult-like following online until 2010 to 2012, after Shrek became a popular character in pun jokes and greentext stories. These fans commonly refer to themselves as "Brogres", in similar vein to the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic enthusiasts known as "Bronies".</p>
